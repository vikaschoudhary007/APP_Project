Using Leibniz Formula to calculate approximate value of PI,
Leibniz formula for PI, is an infinite series that can be used to approximate the value of pi.
π/4 = 1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + 1/9 - 1/11 + ...

Using Taylor series expansion to calculate the sign function
sin(x) = x - (x^3)/3! + (x^5)/5! - (x^7)/7! + ...

Using Taylor series expansion to calculate the Cosine function
cos(x) = 1 - x^2/2! + x^4/4! - x^6/6! + ...

Newton method in Python to solve for alpha given the equation 
α – sin(α) = π/2. 

l = 2R(1 – cos(α/2))    // Using the values of α calculated using the Newton Method
