        A subclass of Circle representing a coaster.

        Attributes:
        - radius (float): radius of the coaster
        - overlap_area (float): area of overlap with another coaster (initialized as None)
        - distance (float): distance needed to shift the coaster for overlap to be half the area (initialized as None)

        Methods:
        - overlap(): calculates the area of overlap with another coaster and returns the value
        - shift_distance(x0): calculates the distance needed to shift the coaster for overlap to be half the area and returns the value
        - display(): returns a string containing information about the coaster (radius, area, circumference, overlap area, distance needed to shift)
        - get_radius(): returns the radius of the coaster

        Inherits methods from Circle:
        - area(): calculates the area of the coaster and returns the value
        - circumference(): calculates the circumference of the coaster and returns the value
