# Using Leibniz Formula to calculate approximate value of PI,
# Leibniz formula for PI, is an infinite series that can be used to approximate the value of pi.
# Ï€/4 = 1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + 1/9 - 1/11 + ...
# this formula uses alternating signs to converge to PI.
# Following is the python code implementation of Leibniz Formula
# number of terms used for approximation
