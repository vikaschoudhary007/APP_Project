# Using Leibniz Formula to calculate approximate value of PI,
# Leibniz formula for PI, is an infinite series that can be used to approximate the value of pi.
# Ï€/4 = 1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + 1/9 - 1/11 + ...
# this formula uses alternating signs to converge to PI.
# Following is the python code implementation of Leibniz Formula
# number of terms used for approximation


def PI():
    """
       Estimate the value of pi using the Leibniz formula and returns the calculated value.

       The Leibniz formula is a way to estimate pi based on an alternating series. The more terms
       of the series that are added together, the more accurate the estimate becomes.

       Returns:
       --------
       float: The estimated value of pi.

       Raises:
       -------
       Exception: If an error occurs during calculation.

       Example:
       --------
       >>> PI()
